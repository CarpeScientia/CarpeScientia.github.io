title: The Monty Hall Problem
---
In a game show when picking a price hidden behind one of three doors, you have a chance of 1 in 3 of picking the price.

However when the game show host then eliminates one of the doors, switching your choice gives you a chance of 2 in 3 of picking the price, while sticking to your original choice still leaves the odds with 1 in 3.

Most people believe that the second pick, after the door elimination, has a 1 in 2 chance of winning.

However most people are wrong.

For more information see here [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

To understand this properly see it as having two picks out of three doors, only one of the picks is done by the host.

This code will calculate the probabilities for a million rounds of the Monty Hall game show.
